 - name: "Crowdsourcing as a Tool for Research: Implications of Uncertaincy"
   description: Numerous crowdsourcing platforms are now available to support research as well as commercial goals. However, crowdsourcing is not yet widely adopted by researchers for generating, processing or analyzing research data. This study develops a deeper understanding of the circumstances under which crowdsourcing is a useful, feasible or desirable tool for research, as well as the factors that may influence researchers’ decisions around adopting crowdsourcing technology. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 researchers in diverse disciplines, spanning the humanities and sciences, to illuminate how research norms and practitioners’ dispositions were related to uncertainties around research processes, data, knowledge, delegation and quality. The paper concludes with a discussion of the design implications for future crowdsourcing systems to support research.

 - name: "Ensemble: A Hybrid Human-Machine System for Generating Melody Scores from Audio"
   description: Music transcription is a highly complex task that is difficult for automated algorithms, and equally challenging to people, even those with many years of musical training. Furthermore, there is a shortage of high-quality datasets for training automated transcription algorithms. In this research, we explore a semi-automated, crowdsourced approach to generate music transcriptions, by first running an automatic melody transcription algorithm on a (polyphonic) song to produce a series of discrete notes representing the melody, and then soliciting the crowd to correct this melody. We present a novel web-based interface that enables the crowd to correct transcriptions, report results from an experiment to understand the capabilities of non-experts to perform this challenging task, and characterize the characteristics and actions of workers and how they correlate with transcription performance.

#  - name: "Proteus: A Platform for Born Digital Critical Editions of Literary and Subliterary Papyri"
#    description: Today, digital libraries, or digital repositories, can be found in nearly any discipline studying collections of text, manuscripts, or other variations of literature. However, many of these digital libraries operate on a traditional model that fails to lend itself to the user outside of fundamental operations (<i>i.e.</i>, Searching). Proteus, still a work-in-progress, leverages modern computing methods and techniques to aid the modern papyrologist in the study and analysis of papyrus fragments.

#  - name: Computationally Accelerated Papyrology
#    description: This thesis presents two computational approaches for accelerating papyrus transcription and identification. The first approach is a computational pipeline that aggregates millions of crowdsourced letter classifications into transcriptions of papyrus fragments. The second approach leverages genetic sequence alignment algorithms to rapidly identify damaged papyrus fragments to known papyrus manuscripts. These approaches greatly improve upon the current state-of-the-art techniques and set a new standard for leveraging computation to the transcription and identification of ancient texts.

#  - name: "A Computational Pipeline for Crowdsourced Transcriptions of Ancient Greek Papyrus Fragments"
#    description: To date, over 7 million letter identifications from users across the world have been recorded in the Ancient Lives database. In this paper, we present a computational pipeline for converting crowdsourced letter identifications made through the Ancient Lives interface into digital consensus transcriptions of papyrus fragments. We conclude by explaining the usefulness of the pipeline output in the context of additional computational projects that aim to further accelerate the identification process.

#  - name: Improving Retrieval Efficacy of Homology Searches using the False Discovery Rate
#    description: In genetic sequence alignment, comparative accuracy of retrieval algorithms (e.g., BLAST) has been rigorously studied for improvement. Unlike most components of retrieval algorithms, the E-value threshold criterion has yet to be thoroughly investigated. An investigation of the threshold is important as it exclusively dictates which sequences are declared relevant and irrelevant. In this paper, we introduce the false discovery rate (FDR) statistic as a replacement for the uniform threshold criterion in order to improve efficacy in retrieval systems

#  - name: Identification of Ancient Greek Papyrus Fragments Using Genetic Sequence Alignment Algorithms
#    description: A key task performed by papyrologists is determining if an unknown fragment belongs to a literary manuscript. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology that uses modern genetic sequence alignment algorithms as a method for identifying Ancient Greek text fragments. This application will offer papyrologists and other professionals in the humanities the ability to rapidly identify severely damaged texts. This approach leverages a new form of non-contextual, multi-line text identification for the Greek language that can greatly accelerate the tedious task of transcription and identification

#  - name: False Discovery Rate for Homology Searches
#    description: While many different aspects of retrieval algorithms (e.g., BLAST) have been studied in depth, the method for determining the retrieval threshold has not enjoyed the same attention. Furthermore, with genetic databases growing rapidly, the challenges of multiple testing are escalating. In order to improve search sensitivity, we propose the use of the false discovery rate (FDR) as the method to control the number of irrelevant (“false positive”) sequences. In this paper, we introduce BLAST-FDR, an extended version of BLAST that uses a FDR method for the threshold criterion.

#  - name: Automated assessment of bilateral breast volume asymmetry as a breast cancer biomarker during mammographic screening.
#    description: The biological concept of bilateral symmetry as a marker of developmental stability and good health is well established. The study suggests that automated assessment of global bilateral asymmetry could serve as a breast cancer risk biomarker for women undergoing mammographic screening. Such biomarker could be used to alert radiologists or computer-assisted detection (CAD) systems to exercise increased vigilance if higher than normal cancer risk is suspected.
