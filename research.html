<div id="block">While many different aspects of the ubiquitous genetic database search algorithms BLAST and PSI-BLAST have been studied, the method for determining the retrieval threshold has yet to be evaluated.  The need to accurately determine relevant sequences is increasing with genetic databases growing rapidly, causing the challenges of multiple testing to escalate.  We can no longer rely on using a uniform E-value threshold to determine the significance of sequences.  In order to improve the search sensitivity of retrieval algorithms, we propose the use of the false discovery rate (FDR) as the method to control the number of irrelevant sequences.  In this paper, we introduce PSI-BLAST<sub>FDR</sub>, an extended version of PSI-BLAST with an FDR method for the threshold criterion.<br>

<div id="block">The biological concept of bilateral symmetry as a marker of developmental stability and good health is well established. Although most individuals deviate slightly from perfect symmetry, humans are essentially considered bilaterally symmetrical. Consequently, increased fluctuating asymmetry of paired structures could be an indicator of disease. There are several published studies linking bilateral breast size asymmetry with increased breast cancer risk. These studies were based on radiologistsâ€™ manual measurements of breast size from mammographic images. We aim to develop a computerized technique to assess fluctuating breast volume asymmetry in screening mammograms and investigate whether it correlates with the presence of breast cancer. Using a large database of screening mammograms with known ground truth we applied automated breast region segmentation and automated breast size measurements in CC and MLO views using three well established methods. All three methods confirmed that indeed patients with breast cancer have statistically significantly higher fluctuating asymmetry of their breast volumes. However, statistically significant difference between patients with cancer and benign lesions was observed only for the MLO views. The study suggests that automated assessment of global bilateral asymmetry could serve as a breast cancer risk biomarker for women undergoing mammographic screening. Such biomarker could be used to alert radiologists or computer-assisted detection (CAD) systems to exercise increased vigilance if higher than normal cancer risk is suspected. <br>

<div id="block">Traditionally, texture analysis and feature extraction methods have been utilized in a variety of vision-centric disciplines to numerically classify trends represented between images.
While these forms of extraction have been exercised on a large-scale interdisciplinary manner, the application of these methods with respect to fluctuating breast volume asymmetry in mammograms has not received the same attention. 
Previous studies have shown that fluctuating breast volume asymmetry can be used as a possible breast cancer biomarker by applying automated breast size measurements in both CC and MLO views. 
This study aims to extend modern information and trends that are directly associated with fluctuating breast volume asymmetry through the application of well-known texture extraction methods.</div>
