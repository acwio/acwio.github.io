   	<dt><b><big>Metroduino: A Metronome on the Arduino microcontroller</big> [<a href="http://cs.mtsu.edu/~acw4a/projects/metroduino.zip">source</a>]</b> <img src ="http://cs.mtsu.edu/~acw4a/projects/metroduino.jpg" width="25%" height="25%" align="right"></dt>
     	<dt>Description:</dt>
      <dd>This project was used during one of two 'Create Your Own' project opportunities for the CSCI 4130 - Microprocessors and Operation Control class. The
      board defaults to a 120 BPM (beats per minute) measurement and will pulse as soon as 
      it is turned on. The program uses an alternative library, MsTimer2, instead of the 
      Timer1, which we used in our Project 6. There are two push-buttons that control the 
      variance of the BPM. One button will raise the BPM and the other will lower the BPM.
      There are two potentiometers on the board. One is responsible for controlling the 
      contrast of the LED display and the other is resposible for controlling the volume
      of the piezo. This implementation has been tested by multiple students and one 
      faculty member of the Department of Music at Middle Tennessee State University
      and has been deemed functional at a professional level. </dd>

   	<dt><b><big>Wireless Arduino Weather Station</big> [<a href="http://cs.mtsu.edu/~acw4a/projects/weatherstation.zip">source</a>]</b></dt>
     	<dt>Description:</dt>
      <dd>This project was used a as a final project for both Anthony Mills and I for our CSCI 4130 - Microcontroller and Operation class.
		The weather station uses two Arduino microcontrollers to wireless communicate using a custom form of
		data tranmission. The microcontrollers have split responsibilities. Anthony's microcontroller was designed to read sensor values
		from each of the board's sensors and send the data to my board. My microcontroller was designed to receive the other microcontroller's
		transmission and update the correct data shown in the GUI that I also developed for this project. The GUI was developed using the 
		Processing library, a library closely related to the Arduino C language.
