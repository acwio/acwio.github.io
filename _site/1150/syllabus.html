      <h3>Class</h3>
      Section 004, CRN 10022<br/>
      11:30 AM - 12:25 PM<br/>
      Mondays, Wednesdays &amp; Fridays<br/>
      KOM 104 or KOM 350<br/>
      <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
      The objective of CSCI 1150 is to equip the student with the following skills:
      <ol>
	<li>The ability to plan, create, and maintain a web site using HTML</li>
	<li>To enhance a website and web pages using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</li>
	<li>Create additional functionality of web pages using JavaScript</li>
	<li>A basic knowledge of programming concepts and programming logic</li>
	<li>A basic understanding of computer hardware, software, networks, Internet and World Wide Web concepts, and Security</li>
	<li>An introduction into Microsoft Office 2013 products, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Access</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Materials</h3>
      In lieu of a textbook, we will be using the content on <a href="http://www.gcflearnfree.org/topics">www.gcflearnfree.org</a>.<br/>
      Additionally, I highly recommend that you have a USB thumb drive for this class to save your files.  Most work will be turned in electronically or put on your webpage.

      <h3>Website</h3>
      The course website is at <a href="http://www.cs.mtsu.edu/~hcarroll/1150/">http://www.cs.mtsu.edu/~hcarroll/1150/</a>.  Announcements and assignments will be posted there and/or emailed to your Pipeline email address.  You are expected to monitor the website and your email account frequently (i.e., at least every other day).

      <h3>Email</h3>
      You must be able to read and respond to e-mails sent to your university Pipeline account. If you'd rather not use MTMail as your primary e-mail system, Dr. Untch put together a tutorial for redirecting your MTMail e-mail to a system you prefer:  <a href="https://www.cs.mtsu.edu/~untch/share/HowToAvoidUsingMTMail.pdf">https://www.cs.mtsu.edu/~untch/share/HowToAvoidUsingMTMail.pdf</a>.
      Additionally, I don't use or check the D2L email account.

      <h3>Lecture</h3>
      Attendance is required by the university.
      If you can not make a lecture, please inform me and get the relevant materials from a classmate.<br/>
      Computers are permitted in lecture for note taking.  Other activities such as web surfing, stock trading, and social networking are inappropriate.  Not only do they distract you but also others.<br/>
      Students that do not attend the first 2 lectures may be dropped from the course.<br/>
      An audible cell phone ring during class will require the possessor to bring cookies (or equivalent) to the next class.<br/>
      
      Additionally, all views are to be heard and engaged respectively.  As scholars, we are expected to analyze subject matter critically and express reasonable positions that are based on logic and fact rather than on emotion.

      Each missed exam will be given zero points<!-- unless acceptable arrangements have been made BEFORE the exam-->.
      Students are expected to complete all projects and assignments.
      Any questions concerning a grade on a homework, lab, or exam must be presented within one week of when the item was returned.
      A grade of "I" will be given only in accordance with University policy.

      Submit homework assignments at <a href="https://1150-004.cs.mtsu.edu/">https://1150-004.cs.mtsu.edu/</a>.
      When promoted, use your <i>personal</i> CS account credentials to gain access.
      The username for your personal CS account is the same as your pipeline ID (two to three letters, a single digit followed by a letter).
      If you don't have a CS account that matches your pipeline ID, request one at <a href="https://mgt.cs.mtsu.edu/aru/">https://mgt.cs.mtsu.edu/aru/</a>.
      For the password for <a href="https://3110.cs.mtsu.edu/">http://3110.cs.mtsu.edu/</a>, use your CS account password (and not your pipeline password).<br/>
      Late homework assignments will NOT be graded.

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      They are due at 11:59 PM on the assigned due date.
      Submit projects at <a href="https://1150-004.cs.mtsu.edu/">https://1150-004.cs.mtsu.edu/</a>.
      Late projects will NOT be graded.
      <!-- Students missing two or more labs will receive an F or FA in this course.      <br/>-->
      <!-- No assignments can be turned in after the last day of classes. -->
      <!--

      <h3>Advice for Succeeding in this Course</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>Attend EVERY class.</li>
	<li>Take notes in class.</li>
	<li>Review notes taken in class.</li>
	<li>Start working on the projects and homework as soon as possible, and seek help as soon as needed. Do NOT wait for the last minute to work on your labs.</li>
	<li>Ask questions during class or after class. Do NOT wait until test time to ask all of your questions.</li>
	<li>Find study buddies to study together (but do your own work).</li>
	<li>Do your own work; zeros can drastically hurt your grade.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Honor Code</h3>
      It is expected that all work for this class (including exams, homework and labs) is your own.  The university policy for academic misconduct is as follows:
      <div style="margin-left: 1em;">      
	Middle Tennessee State University takes a strong stance against academic misconduct.  Academic Misconduct includes, but is not limited to, plagiarism, cheating, and fabrication.<br/>
	Academic Misconduct:  Plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, or facilitating any such act.  For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
	<ol>
	  <li>Plagiarism:  The adoption or reproduction of ideas, words, statements, images, or works of another person as one's own without proper acknowledgment.</li>
	  <li>Cheating:  Using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in any academic exercise.  The term academic exercise includes all forms of work submitted for credit or hours.</li>
	  <li>Fabrication:  Unauthorized falsification or invention of any information or citation in an academic exercise.</li>
	</ol>
      </div>
      To summarize, turning in someone else's work and saying it's yours is academic misconduct.
      This includes using code or answers from a webpage and other student's work.
      Do NOT give other students your code.
      You are responsible for facilitating others.
      <br/>
      All cases of academic misconduct will be reported to the Office of Academic Affairs for violating the academic honesty requirements in the student handbook.
      They may also result in failure in the course.
      Remember, ignorance is NOT a defense.

      <h3>Financial Aid Notice</h3>
      Students receiving any form of financial aid should always consult the Financial Aid Office before dropping a course.  For additional information, contact the Financial Aid Office (898-2830) or see <a href="http://www.mtsu.edu/financialaid">http://www.mtsu.edu/financialaid</a>.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <h4>Lottery Scholarship Information</h4>
      Do you have a lottery scholarship?  To retain the Tennessee Education Lottery Scholarship eligibility, you must earn a cumulative TELS GPA of 2.75 after 24 and 48 attempted hours and a cumulative TELS GPA of 3.0 thereafter.  A grade of C, D, F, FA, or I in this class may negatively impact TELS eligibility. <br/>
      If you drop this class, withdraw, or if you stop attending this class you may lose eligibility for your lottery scholarship, and you will not be able to regain eligibility at a later time.<br/>

      For additional Lottery rules, please refer to your Lottery Statement of Understanding form (<a href="http://www.mtsu.edu/financial-aid/forms/LOTFOD.pdf">http://www.mtsu.edu/financial-aid/forms/LOTFOD.pdf</a>) or contact your MT One Stop Enrollment Counselor (<a href="http://www.mtsu.edu/one-stop/counselor.php">http://www.mtsu.edu/one-stop/counselor.php</a>).

      <h3>Reporting of Unofficial Withdrawals</h3>
      Federal regulations require that students who cease class attendance but do not officially withdraw from the University must be reported so that future financial aid will cease and/or the student will be required to return funds. Therefore, during the term I will be required to complete a roster indicating those students who have stopped attending class without officially withdrawing. Faculty members are not required to check attendance each day; however, I may use project submission deadlines, exams, quizzes, advising appointments, or other methods I choose to determine unofficial withdraws.

      <h3>Reasonable Accommodation for Students with Disabilities</h3>
      If you have a disability that may require assistance or accommodation, or you have questions related to any accommodations for testing, note takers, readers, etc., please speak with me as soon as possible. Students may also contact the <a href="http://www.mtsu.edu/~dssemail/">Office of Disabled Students Services</a> (898-2783) with questions about such services.

      <h3>Accreditation Activities</h3>
      Samples of graded work may be collected for our accreditation team. Identifying information will be removed from any such work collected.
