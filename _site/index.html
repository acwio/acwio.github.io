                    I'm a PhD student in the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I work with <a href="http://www.edithlaw.ca"> Edith Law</a>, and am a member of the <a href="http://hci.uwaterloo.ca">Human-Computer Interaction Lab</a>. Before joining Waterloo, I was a research scientist in the Faculty of Classics at the <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk">University of Oxford</a>, and spent two summers as a research intern in <a href="http://www.ornl.gov">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a>'s Biomedical Sciences and Engineering division.

                    My PhD work focuses on the intersection of curiosity, citizen science, and artificial intelligence. My research consolidates questions from each of these areas to better understand how we can get volunteers and crowd-workers more excited about and involved in participating in crowd-scale scientific research.

                        Music transcription is a highly complex task that is difficult for automated algorithms, and equally challenging to people, even those with many years of musical training. Furthermore, there is a shortage of high-quality datasets for training automated transcription algorithms. In this research, we explore a semi-automated, crowdsourced approach to generate music transcriptions, by first running an automatic melody transcription algorithm on a (polyphonic) song to produce a series of discrete notes representing the melody, and then soliciting the crowd to correct this melody. We present a novel web-based interface that enables the crowd to correct transcriptions, report results from an experiment to understand the capabilities of non-experts to perform this challenging task, and characterize the characteristics and actions of workers and how they correlate with transcription performance.

                        Today, digital libraries, or digital repositories, can be found in nearly any discipline studying collections of text, manuscripts, or other variations of literature. However, many of these digital libraries operate on a traditional model that fails to lend itself to the user outside of fundamental operations (<i>i.e.</i>, Searching). Proteus, still a work-in-progress, leverages modern computing methods and techniques to aid the modern papyrologist in the study and analysis of papyrus fragments.

                        This thesis presents two computational approaches for accelerating papyrus transcription and identification. The first approach is a computational pipeline that aggregates millions of crowdsourced letter classifications into transcriptions of papyrus fragments. The second approach leverages genetic sequence alignment algorithms to rapidly identify damaged papyrus fragments to known papyrus manuscripts. These approaches greatly improve upon the current state-of-the-art techniques and set a new standard for leveraging computation to the transcription and identification of ancient texts.

                        To date, over 7 million letter identifications from users across the world have been recorded in the Ancient Lives database. In this paper, we present a computational pipeline for converting crowdsourced letter identifications made through the Ancient Lives interface into digital consensus transcriptions of papyrus fragments. We conclude by explaining the usefulness of the pipeline output in the context of additional computational projects that aim to further accelerate the identification process.

                        In genetic sequence alignment, comparative accuracy of retrieval algorithms (e.g., BLAST) has been rigorously studied for improvement. Unlike most components of retrieval algorithms, the E-value threshold criterion has yet to be thoroughly investigated. An investigation of the threshold is important as it exclusively dictates which sequences are declared relevant and irrelevant. In this paper, we introduce the false discovery rate (FDR) statistic as a replacement for the uniform threshold criterion in order to improve efficacy in retrieval systems

                        A key task performed by papyrologists is determining if an unknown fragment belongs to a literary manuscript. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology that uses modern genetic sequence alignment algorithms as a method for identifying Ancient Greek text fragments. This application will offer papyrologists and other professionals in the humanities the ability to rapidly identify severely damaged texts.

                        While many different aspects of retrieval algorithms (e.g., BLAST) have been studied in depth, the method for determining the retrieval threshold has not enjoyed the same attention. Furthermore, with genetic databases growing rapidly, the challenges of multiple testing are escalating. In order to improve search sensitivity, we propose the use of the false discovery rate (FDR) as the method to control the number of irrelevant (“false positive”) sequences. In this paper, we introduce BLAST-FDR, an extended version of BLAST that uses a FDR method for the threshold criterion.

                        The biological concept of bilateral symmetry as a marker of developmental stability and good health is well established. The study suggests that automated assessment of global bilateral asymmetry could serve as a breast cancer risk biomarker for women undergoing mammographic screening. Such biomarker could be used to alert radiologists or computer-assisted detection (CAD) systems to exercise increased vigilance if higher than normal cancer risk is suspected.
