					<p style="text-align: justify">
						In 2019, a Forbes article stated that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/08/29/software-ate-the-world-now-ai-is-eating-software/#35c7fac58107">"Software Ate The World, Now AI Is Eating Software"</a>. From social media platforms to motor vehicles, our lives have become intertwined with technologies that makes predictions about the world around us. It is generally expected that, as time moves forward, predictive technology will continue to thread our lives, for better or worse.

						Your final project is a team project in which you will explore the gamut of practical machine learning. You will be evaluated both individually and as a team. The project spans an 10-week period, separated by 5 milestones:

							<!-- <h2>Milestone 1: Setting</h2> -->
							<p>
								The objective of the Milestone 1 (M1) is identifying a problem setting. Far too often, machine learning is applied to problem spaces that "don't matter". However, an important consideration for "what matters" is that it is inherently <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04510.pdf">debatable</a>. We make thousands of decisions each day that influence us in small, but meaningful ways. Your project should hone in one such decision.
							</p>
							<p></p>

							<h3>I. Milestone Requirements</h3>
							<p>
								This milestone requires that your team successfully identify a problem you have chosen for your project. The requirements of this milestone are as follows:
								<ol>
									<li>Your team must have the instructor's permission that a topic is suitable for the course.</li>
									<li>Your team's setting must be compliant with the constraints (see <i>II. Setting Constraints</i>).</li>
									<li>Your team must submit a document, by the due date, that includes the following:</li>
										<ul>
											<li>A clear articulation of whether you are solving a classification or regression problem.</li>
											<li>A brief paragraph describing why the problem matters.</li>
											<li>A statement describing the contributions of each team member.</li>
										</ul>
								</ol>
								<strong>Note:</strong> Your report must be submitted by 11:59pm on October 9 via Canvas.
							</p>
							<p></p>
							
							<h3>II. Setting Constraints</h3>
							<p>
								To guide you in identifying your problem setting, your team's problem must fall into one of the following thematic areas:
							</p>
							<div style="border: 2px solid #337ab7; border-radius: 5px;">
								<ul class="nav nav-pills nav-justified"  style="padding: 5px">

										<h4>Theme I: Machine Learning for Productivity</h4>
										<p>
											<p>
												Productivity is a frontier for learning. Organizations care about maximizing peoples' output when they're on the job. The more people productive or efficient that people are in their job, the closer a company is toward reaching its output goals.
											</p>
		
											<p>
												Example problems include:
												<ul>
													<li>Classifying if a person is in a focused state or not at their computer.</li>
													<li>Predicting the number of bugs a software engineer will fix today.</li>
													<li>Classifying "morning people" and "afternoon people" in terms of productivity.</li>
												</ul>
											</p>

									<div id="theme-wellbeing" class="tab-pane fade">
										<h4>Theme II: Machine Learning for Wellbeing</h4>
										<p>
											<p>
												Research research suggests that productivity is intwertwined with peoples' well-being. Burnout, for example, was recognized as public health epidemic in 2018. Today, we're currently operating in a near-virtual world under the Coronavirus pandemic, which continues to challenges in new and surprising ways. 
											</p>
											
											<p>
												Example problems include:
												<ul>
													<li>Classifying if a person needs to take a break from work.</li>
													<li>Classifying people between those who needs more sleep and those who don't.</li>
													<li>Predicting the amount of "unhealthy" time spent on social media.</li>
												</ul>

									</div>
									<div id="theme-discourse" class="tab-pane fade">
									<h4>Theme III: Machine Learning for Online Discourse</h4>
									<p>
										<p>
											From heated exchanges in political niches to simple disagreements on Facebook updates, online discourse has remained just about anything, but "friendly". Our efforts to have meaningful discourse on the Internet are amplified by third-party actors who leverage the open nature of the Internet to disinform and confuse.
										</p>
										
										<p>
											Examples problems include:
											<ul>
												<li>Classifying online communities (e.g. subreddits) as echo chambers.</li>
												<li>Classifying online post has harmful to discourse (e.g. trolling, harassment).</li>
												<li>Classifying fake news on social media websites.</li>
											</ul>

									</div>
									<div id="theme-covid" class="tab-pane fade">
									<h4>Theme IV: Machine Learning for COVID-19</h4>
									<p>
										<p>
											The Coronavirus pandemic has forced us to adapt to new learning, working, and personal environments in ways the world's population was not prepared for. In what ways can machine learning help us navigate a world where we, or those around us, need to feel safe? 
										</p>
	
										<p>
											Example problems include:
											<ul>
												<li>Classifying physical locations as low-risk/high-risk for COVID-19 exposure across TN.</li>
												<li>Classifying health-related misinformation in Wikipedia Edits.</li>
												<li>Predicting the number of mask-wearers in local grocery stores.</li>
