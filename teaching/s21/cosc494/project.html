							<!-- <h2>Milestone 1: Setting</h2> -->
							<p>
								The objective of the Milestone 1 (M1) is identifying an opportunity and a setting. Historically, some of the most significant leaps and bounds in technology have been underminded by an inability to ``solve a problem''. Your project should hone in one specific opportunity for a new intelligent and interactive system.
							</p>
							<p></p>

							<h3>I. Milestone Requirements</h3>
							<p>
								This milestone requires that your team successfully identifies a setting for your project. The requirements of this milestone are as follows:
								<ol>
									<li>Your team must have the instructor's permission that a topic is suitable for the course.</li>
									<li>Your team's setting must be compliant with the constraints (see <i>II. Use-Case Constraints</i>).</li>
									<!-- <li>Your team must give a four0-slide presentation on Feb. 23 that has the following information:</li> -->
										<ul>
											<li>Slide 1: A use-case with a clearly articulated domain and task.</li>
											<li>Slide 2: A user modelling approach with a detailed feature set.</li>
											<li>Slide 3: A high-level technical architecture of your system.</li>
											<li>Slide 4: An overview of AI potentials and risks.</li>
										</ul>
								</ol>
							</p>
							<p></p>
							
							<h3>II. Use-Case Constraints</h3>
							<p>
								To guide you in identifying your problem setting, your team's problem must fall into one of the following thematic areas:
							</p>
							<div style="border: 2px solid #337ab7; border-radius: 5px;">
								<ul class="nav nav-pills nav-justified"  style="padding: 5px">

										<h4>Theme I: Recommenders for Productivity</h4>
										<p>
											<p>
												Productivity is a frontier for intelligent interaction. Organizations care about maximizing peoples' output when they're on the job. The more people productive or efficient that people are in their job, the closer a company is toward reaching its output goals.
											</p>
		
											<p>
												Example use-cases include:
												<ul>
													<li>A recommender system that helps programmers choose which functions to implement first in a new file.</li>
													<li>A reccommender system that helps authors write paragraphs of next.</li>
													<li>A recommender system that helps people manage their time.</li>
												</ul>
											</p>

									<div id="theme-wellbeing" class="tab-pane fade">
										<h4>Theme II: Recommenders for Wellbeing</h4>
										<p>
											<p>
												Research research suggests that productivity is intwertwined with peoples' well-being. Burnout, for example, was recognized as public health epidemic in 2018. Today, we're currently operating in a near-virtual world under the Coronavirus pandemic, which continues to challenges in new and surprising ways. 
											</p>
											
											<p>
												Example problems include:
												<ul>
													<li>A recommender system that helps people with predisposed conditions avoid COVID-19.</li>
													<li>A recommender system that helps students master material for a course.</li>
													<li>A recommender system that helps parents manage children's physical development.</li>

									</div>
									<div id="theme-discourse" class="tab-pane fade">
									<h4>Theme III: Recommenders for Online Discourse</h4>
									<p>
										<p>
											From heated exchanges in political niches to simple disagreements on Facebook updates, online discourse has remained just about anything, but "friendly". Our efforts to have meaningful discourse on the Internet are amplified by third-party actors who leverage the open nature of the Internet to disinform and confuse.
										</p>
										
										<p>
											Examples problems include:
											<ul>
												<li>A recommender system for helping people identify truthful information.</li>
												<li>A recommender system for helping people avoid toxic interactions in online gaming.</li>
												<li>A recommender system for helping people speak in a toxic manner online.</li>

							<p></p>
							<p>
								The objective of the Milestone 2 (M2) is broadly understanding the needs of the user population that your system will engage with. Intelligent systems should be focused on supporting a particular task, and they should support it well. Through Milestone 2, you should adequately develop and carry out a needfinding plan for your system. If nothing else, you should understand the importance of understanding user needs before you consider implementing or prototyping any technical component within your system.
							</p>
							<p></p>

							<h3>I. Milestone Requirements</h3>
							<p>
								This milestone requires that your team successfully identifies a setting for your project. The requirements of this milestone are as follows:
								<ol>
									<li>Your team must give a three-slide presentation on March 16 that has the following information:</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Slide 1: A set of five unique personas of system users.</li>

								The objective of the Milestone 3 (M3) is prototyping an intelligent interface. In Milestone 2, you used personas to motivate your system design. You also engaged a small number of users to better understand the challenges and opportunities of bringing your system into practice. Your intelligent interface prototype for Milestone 3 should be motivated based on findings in the needfinding examination in Milestone 2. Protoyping can take place in one of three ways described below.
							</p>
							<p></p>

							<h3>I. Milestone Requirements</h3>
							<p>
								This milestone requires that your team successfully produce a prototype following one of the pathways described in Section II: Prototype Pathways. The requirements of this milestone are as follows:
								<ol>
									<li>Your team must give a four-slide presentation on March 16 that has the following information:</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Slide 1: A very brief review of your use-case and what was learned in Milestone 2.</li>
											<li>Slide 2: An overview of your initial prototype.</li>
											<li>Slide 3: An overview of your approach to iteration.</li>
											<li>Slide 4: An overview of your final prototype.</li>
										</ul>
									<li>Your presentation is limited to three and a half minutes with one minute of Q&A.</li>
								</ol>

								<strong>Note:</strong> Your report must be submitted by 11:59pm on April 6 via Canvas.
							</p>

							<h3>II. Prototype Requirements</h3>
							<p>
								Your prototype should clearly show the following:
								<ol>
									<li><strong>Interaction Foundation</strong>: How users fundamentally engage with the intelligent interface. For example, if your intelligent interface is conversational (e.g., uses human language to engage users), your prototype should include clear visual examples of this interaction.</li>

									<li><strong>Onboarding Interaction</strong>: How users are introduced to the intelligent interface. What is the mechanism your interface uses to introduce "itself" and make its functionality known? For example, does your intelligent interface proactively engage new users? If not, how are users made aware that it exists? You can assume the user is familiar with the base application, e.g. Google Maps in the Map Assistant example.</li>

									<li><strong>Recommendation Interaction</strong>: How users are given recommendations and what options they have when receiving them. Is the interaction as simple as "Accept" or "Dismiss"? Some recommendations, for example, come at inopportune times. Are there options for deferring recommendations? Consider your options for what is appropriate for your use-case.</li>

									<li><strong>Feedback Interaction</strong>: How users are capable of giving feedback for recommendation improvement. Is feedback given to the agent directly (e.g., "Hey Siri, you're doing terribly.") or through a separate free-text form box. What does your interface say after feedback has been provided?</li>
								</ol>
							</p>

							<h3>III. Prototype Pathways</h3>

							<p>
								There are three possible pathways that you can take for creating prototypes for Milestone 3: (1) Lo-Fi Protoype, (2) Hi-Fi Prototype, and (3) Hybrid Prototypes. Your team should pick one pathway.

											<h4>Pathway 1: The Lo-Fi Prototype</h4>
											<p>
												<p>
													The Lo-Fi Prototype pathway requires that you create an initial low-fi prototype, iterate on it by engaging potential users for feedback, and then revising your low-fi prototype based on what you observe or discover in your user feedback.
												</p>
												
												<h4>Pathway Requirements</h4>
												<p>
													For this pathway, your team should create three supplementary documents:
													<ul>
														<li>A low-fi prototype that clearly shows the four aforementioned interaction requirements. The various parts of the prototype should be saved as an independent PDF file.
															
														<li>An Interface Schematic with annotations/comments that describe what each component of the Interaction Foundation of the interface. An example schematic can be found on Slides 28 and 29 of Lecture 12. The Interaction Schematic should be saved as an independent PDF file.</li>

														<li>A revised low-fi prototype that clearly shows how the four aforementioned interaction requirements have been updated after engaging potential users. The various parts of the prototype should be saved as an independent PDF file.
													</ul>
												</p>

												<h4>Low-Fi Prototyping Guidelines and Tools</h4>
												<p>
													Example low-fi prototypes include:
													<ul>
														<li>Paper Prototypes</li>
														<li>Wireframes or Mock-Ups</li>
													</ul>

													There are no constraints around which tool you can use to create your low-fi prototypes. Here are several openly available tools that you can use to help with your prototyping:

													<ul>
														<li><a href="https://mockflow.com">Mockflow</a></li>
														<li><a href="https://excalidraw.com">Excalidraw</a></li>

											<h4>Pathway 2: The Hi-Fi Prototype</h4>
											<p>
												<p>
													The Hi-Fi Prototype pathway requires that you create an initial low-fi prototype, iterate on it by engaging potential users for feedback, and then create a Hi-Fi prototype based on what you observe or discover in your user feedback.
												</p>
												
												<h4>Pathway Requirements</h4>

													</ul>
												</p>

												<h4>Hi-Fi Prototyping Guidelines and Tools</h4>
												<p>
													Hi-fi prototypes are prototypes that very closely resemble the interface that users would use. They can be high-definition mock-ups or implementations of your intelligent interface that are fully implemented or implemented through simulated means. For Hi-Fi prototypes, you may simulate the following:
													<ul>
														<li>Database interactions, e.g. querying for information, etc.</li>
														<li>Intelligent behavior, e.g. simulating a recommender system</li>
													</ul>

													An example of a Hi-Fi prototype is the Volflix starter code that you received for Project 2. The Volflix UI was functional, despite simulating "intelligent recommendations" with a static set of data being returned from the server.

													There are no constraints around how you create your Hi-Fi prototypes. If you choose to implement a hi-fi prototype, it is recommended that you use HTML, CSS, JavaScript for your prototype. You may also use CSS frameworks and libraries (e.g. Bootstrap, Material UI, etc) to build interfaces that are stylized nicely.
