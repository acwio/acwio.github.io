					<h2 id="description">Overview</h2>

					<p style="text-align: justify">
						This project is required for all students enrolled in COSC 523. It is optional for students enrolled in COSC 423. This project requires that you:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Pick an application domain that interests you.</li>
						<li>Identify a problem in that application domain.</li>
						<li>Choose a project pathway.</li>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Pathway #1: AI as a Tool</strong>: Introducing and evaluating a modification to an existing algorithm (e.g., A*), e.g. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187770581403149X">Path Planning with Modified a Star Algorithm for a Mobile Robot</a>. Projects in this pathway should:
							
								<ol>
									<li>Introduce and describe a new technique.</li>
									<li>Implement the technique.</li>
									<li>Design an evaluation with empirical or simulated data.</li>
									<li>Compare the technique's performance with one existing technique.</li>
								</ol>
							
							</li>
							<li><strong>Pathway #2: AI as an Application</strong>: Building machine learning models for a particular domain setting and evaluating them appropriately, e.g. <a href="/pubs/icwsm2021-AITA.pdf">predicting /r/AITA votes with data from Reddit</a>. Projects in this pathway should:
							
							<ol>
								<li>Find or collect a dataset for machine learning use.</li>
								<li>Implement and train models with the dataset, i.e. with scikit-learn or Keras.</li>
								<li>Design an evaluation that compares the performance of multiple models.</li>
							</ol>
							</li>
							<li><strong>Pathway #3: AI as an Interface</strong>: Implementing interfaces that act "intelligently" and facilitate recommendations and/or search, e.g. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/302979.303030">Microsoft's LookOut system</a>. Projects in this pathway should:
							
								<ol>
									<li>Describe a scenario for integrating intelligence (e.g., recommendations) into an interface.</li>
									<li>Implement an interface prototype that demonstrates the concept.</li>
									<li>Conduct an informal user study with the prototype aimed at understanding how the new interfaces changes the nature of the application area.</li>
								</ol></li>
						</ul>
						<li>Prepare a proposal. Cite, at least, 5 or 6 research papers to motivate your project.</li>
						<li>Conduct an appropriate evaluation for your pathway.</li>
						<li>Write a final report about your project, its implementation, and your findings.</li>
						<li>Undergraduate students can form terms of up to 3 people, but graduate students may form teams of two</li>

							<!-- <h2>Milestone 1: Setting</h2> -->
							<p>
								The objective of the Milestone 1 (M1) is to submit a one-page project proposal. Far too often, AI techniques and methods are applied to problem spaces that "don't matter". However, an important consideration for "what matters" is that it is inherently <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04510.pdf">debatable</a>. We make thousands of decisions each day that influence us in small, but meaningful ways. Project proposals should hone in one such decision.
							</p>
							<p></p>

							<h3>I. Milestone Requirements</h3>
							<p>
								This milestone requires that your team successfully identify a problem you have chosen for your project. The requirements of this milestone are as follows:
								<ol>
									<li>Your team must have the instructor's permission that a topic is suitable for the course.</li>
									<li>Your team's setting must be compliant with the constraints outlined above.</li>
									<li>Your team must submit a one-page document, by the due date, that includes the following sections:</li>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Problem Description:</strong> A clear articulation of the problem and the project pathway that the project falls under.</li>
											<li><strong>Problem Motivation:</strong> A brief paragraph describing why the problem matters.</li>
											<li><strong>Planned Activities:</strong> An overview of the activities that will take place during the project.</li>
										</ul>
								</ol>
								<strong>Note:</strong> Your report must be submitted by 11:59pm on October 26 via Canvas.
							</p>
							<p></p>
						</div>
						<div id="milestone4" class="tab-pane fade">
							<p></p>
							<p>
								The objective of the Milestone 2 (M2) is submitting a final report based on your project, its implementation, and any findings related to your project. Your docment should be written with the <a href="https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit20.zip">AAAI 2020 Author Kit</a>. It is advisable that your team write in LaTeX. The easiest way to collaborate on LaTeX documents is through <a href="https://www.overleaf.com">Overleaf</a>.
							</p>
							<p></p>

							<h3>I. Milestone Requirements</h3>
							<p>
								The requirements of this milestone are as follows:
								<ol>
									<li><strong>Final Report:</strong> Your team must submit a document in the AAAI format, by the due date, that includes the following:</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Your document should include six sections:</li>
											<ul>
												<li>Introduction: Describe why your project matters.</li>
												<li>Approach: Describe your approach.</li>
												<li>Implementation: Describe your approach.</li>
												<li>Evaluation: Describe your evaluation.</li>
												<li>Future Work: Describe what could follow your work.</li>
												<li>Contributions: Describe the contributions of each team member.</li>
											</ul>
											<li>The document should be, at most, 8 pages in length.</li>
										</ul>
								</ol>

								<strong>Note:</strong> Your report must be submitted by 11:59pm on November 30 via Canvas. Note that it is perfectly permissible to re-use text from prior Milestone submissions for this final report. You should aim to submit a report that is well-written and clearly articulates all aspects of your team's work.

								</ul>

								<h3>II. Grading</h3>
								This milestone is worth 20% of your final project grade. The 20% is calculated like so:
								<table class="table text-left">
									<tr><td>Deliverable</td><td>Description</td><td>Value</td></tr>
									<tr class="new-week">
										<td>Proposal</td><td>A written proposal exists with all required information.</td><td>2.5%</td>
									</tr>
									<tr class="related">
										<td></td><td>Proposal is grammatically and structurally well-written.</td><td>2.5%</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>Final Report</td><td>Report articulates all aspects of project effectively.</td><td>12.5%</td>
									</tr>
									<tr class="related">
										<td></td><td>Report is grammatically and structurally well-written.</td><td>2.5%</td>
									</tr>
